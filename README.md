This is a simple mod that adds a bunch of genes in for custom eye colours. All vanilla factions that don't have a default eye override will receive eyes based on their distinct characteristics.

- Human - 76 New Colours
- Feline - 76 Eye Colours
- Reptile - 76 Eye Colours

Recommended to use this mod with [Camera+](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=867467808) as the eyes will be small and hard to see the details.
